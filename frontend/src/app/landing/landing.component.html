      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What is a Hackathon?</summary>
        <p>A hackathon is not a place where people get together and try to break into websites. To us, hacking is when people come together to create awesome technical projects. People from all over the world will come together for Hackathons every few weeks, working together to make something amazing. Along the way there’s usually fun, food, and prizes.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Do I need to be good at programming?</summary>
        <p>Nope! We’re going to have lots of volunteers and mentors who can help you throughout the weekend. On top of that, we’ve put together some awesome resources to help you get started with any language of platform you want.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How do I apply?</summary>
        <p>Just sign up <a href="/#/register" [routerLink]="['/register']">here!</a> with your Purdue email and fill out the application form. We’ll let you know in the next few weeks if you’ve been accepted.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Do I need to pay?</summary>
        <p>Nope! Hello World is completely free. Just show up with your laptop and charger, and we’ll provide the food, friends, prizes, and mentors.</p>

      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What are the rules?</summary>
        <p>The project you make for Hello World has to be brand new-- you can’t use code that you’ve written before the event. And of course, be respectful of others. Harassment and abuse are never tolerated.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>When is Hello World?</summary>
        <p>Hello World will take place on September 16th and 17th. We’ll have mentors and volunteers in the building for all 24 hours, so you can code through the night if you want! We’ll have a more detailed schedule coming soon.</p>
